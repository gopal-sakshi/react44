react-dom package 
- provides both server & client.


react-dom/client 
- helps to render the components on the client means browser
- It can't be used for server side development. 
    Ex: renderToString for SSR is exported from react-dom/server but not from react-dom/client
- react-dom/client thing is new in v18

react-dom/server 
- APIs let you render React components to HTML on the server
