How does React work
- React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
- Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, 
    React creates a virtual DOM in memory, 
    where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
- React only changes what needs to be changed!
- React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
